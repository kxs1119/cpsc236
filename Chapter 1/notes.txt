Displaying Output with the print Function 
  Function: piece of prewritten code that performs an operation

  print function: displays output on the screen

  Argument: data given to a function
    Example: data or message being printed on the screen 
  
  Program will execute in the order that is given
    Top to bottom
Comments 
  Definition: notes of explanation within a program 
    Ignored by the IDE or interperater
      Intended for developers or others to reading the program's code
  End-line comments: appears at the end of a line of code
    Typically used for documentation for other developers
Variable 
  Definition: name that represents a value stored in the computer memory
    Used to access and manipulate data stored in memory

    A variable reference the value it represents

  Assignment statement: used to create a variable and make it reference data 
    General format: variable = expression 
      Example: age = 29
      Assignment operator is equal sign (=)
Numeric Data Types, Literals, and the str Data Type 
  Data types: categorize value in memory
    Data types consist of:
      Str = string
      int = integer
      float = floating point
Reading Input from the Keyboard
  Built in input function read input from keyboard 
    Format: variable = input(prompt)
      prompt: is typically a string instructing user to enter a value
Reading Numbers with the input Function
  input function always return a string 

  Built in functions convert between data types 
    int(variable) converts variable to an int

    float(variable) converts variable to a float

    Nested function call: general format: 
      function(function2(Argument))

        value returned by function 2 and is passed to function 1

        example 
          price = float(input("Enter the price: "))
Performing Calculations 
  Math expression: performs calculation and gives a value
    Math operator: tool for performing calculation 
    Operands: values surronding operator
  Two types of division 
    "/" operator performs floating point division
    "//" operator performs integer division 
The exponent Operator and the Remainder operator
  "**" raises a number to a power
    x ** y = x^y
Remainder operator
  "%" performs division and returns the remainder 
    also known as modulus operator 

    e.g. 4 % 2 = 0, 5 % 2 = 1
Breaking Long Statement into Multiple Lines 
  Multiple continuation character (\)
    Allows to break a statement into multiple lines
More About Data Output
  Special arguent end='delimiter' causes print to place delimeter at
   end of data instead of newline 

  Seperator special function sep= causes print to use delimeter as item Seperator

Escape Sequences
Magic Numbers
  Definition: an unexplained numeric value that apperars in a program's code
Named Constant
   name all constants instead of magic numvers
